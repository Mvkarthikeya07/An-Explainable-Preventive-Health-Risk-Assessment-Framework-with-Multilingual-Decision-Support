# 🩺 An Explainable Preventive Health Risk Assessment Framework with Multilingual Decision Support

## 📌 Abstract

This project presents a **Preventive Health Risk Analysis and Multilingual Decision Support System** aimed at improving early health awareness and preventive decision-making among diverse and underserved populations. The system evaluates individual health risk levels using physiological and lifestyle indicators and provides **explainable, multilingual, and voice-assisted guidance** through an interactive web interface and a deterministic health assistant chatbot.

Designed with a **prevention-first and transparency-oriented philosophy**, the system prioritizes interpretability, accessibility, and safety over opaque black-box intelligence. The project is particularly relevant for public health informatics, responsible AI, and accessibility-focused healthcare technologies.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* To assess **preventive health risk levels** (Low / Moderate / High) using a rule-based risk stratification framework.
* To provide **clear, non-diagnostic health guidance** understandable to non-medical users.
* To support **multiple Indian languages** for wider public accessibility.
* To enable **voice-based interaction** for illiterate and semi-literate users.
* To design an **explainable and deterministic system** suitable for healthcare-oriented applications.

---

## 🧠 Methodology

The system employs a **rule-based health risk assessment engine** derived from widely accepted preventive health thresholds (e.g., BMI ranges, blood pressure categories, blood glucose levels, and lifestyle risk indicators). Each health parameter contributes to a cumulative risk score based on predefined rules and weights.

### Key Methodological Choices

* **Rule-Based Logic:** Ensures transparency, interpretability, and predictable behavior—critical in healthcare contexts.
* **Explainable Outputs:** Users receive risk classifications accompanied by clear explanations and preventive suggestions.
* **Language-Aware Responses:** All system outputs are mapped through a translation layer to support multilingual delivery.
* **Deterministic NLP Chatbot:** Keyword-based intent matching avoids hallucinations and ensures safe responses.

This approach intentionally prioritizes **explainability and safety** over probabilistic accuracy, aligning with responsible AI principles in healthcare.

---

## 🧪 Health Risk Assessment Parameters

The preventive risk analysis considers the following inputs:

* Age
* Body Mass Index (BMI)
* Blood Pressure
* Blood Sugar Level
* Smoking Habits
* Physical Activity Levels
* Lifestyle Factors

Based on cumulative scoring, users are classified into:

* **Low Risk** – Preventive maintenance guidance
* **Moderate Risk** – Lifestyle improvement recommendations
* **High Risk** – Strong preventive warnings and professional consultation advice

---

## 🤖 Multilingual Health Assistant (Chatbot)

The integrated health assistant provides:

* Diet and nutrition guidance
* Physical activity recommendations
* General preventive health advice
* Risk explanation and lifestyle tips

### Chatbot Characteristics

* Rule-based NLP with intent matching
* Multilingual, language-aware responses
* Voice-enabled output
* Deterministic and safe behavior (no generative hallucinations)

---

## 🌍 Accessibility & Inclusion

To ensure inclusivity, especially for underserved populations, the system incorporates:

* Voice-based narration of health results
* Voice-assisted chatbot responses
* Minimal text dependency
* Simple and guided user interface design

---

## 🌐 Supported Languages

The system currently supports five languages selected to maximize accessibility in the Indian context:

* English
* Hindi
* Telugu
* Tamil
* Malayalam

---

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

### Backend

* Python
* Flask

### Frontend

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

### Core Logic

* Rule-Based Health Risk Engine
* Rule-Based NLP Chatbot (Intent Matching)

### Voice & Accessibility

* Web Speech API (Text-to-Speech)
* Multilingual Voice Output

---

## 🧪 Evaluation & Validation

The system was evaluated using **synthetic and rule-consistent user profiles** representing diverse age groups, physiological ranges, and lifestyle patterns.

### Evaluation Focus

* Consistency of risk classification across boundary conditions
* Correct handling of edge cases (e.g., borderline BMI or BP values)
* Stability and predictability of chatbot responses
* Verification of multilingual output consistency

Although the system does not claim clinical diagnostic accuracy, its outputs were manually validated against standard preventive health thresholds to ensure logical correctness.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

* The system does **not provide medical diagnoses** and is intended solely for preventive awareness.
* Rule-based logic lacks adaptive learning and may not generalize to complex clinical scenarios.
* No real patient data was used due to ethical and privacy considerations.
* Multilingual translations are rule-mapped and may lack contextual nuance.

These limitations are intentionally accepted to preserve transparency, safety, and ethical deployment.

---

## 🌱 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Alignment

This project contributes to the following UN SDGs:

* **SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-Being:** Promotes early preventive health awareness.
* **SDG 10 – Reduced Inequalities:** Enables access for non-English and illiterate users.
* **SDG 9 – Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure:** Demonstrates deployable, lightweight healthcare technology.

By enabling low-cost, accessible preventive healthcare support, the system aligns with sustainable public health objectives.
